This project uses the socket.io and simple-peer libraries to create a video and text chat application, connecting multiple pairs of users one-to-one. Users are not able to directly choose their chat partner, hence the name "randomchat". Throughout this application's code, clients are referred to as "first" or "second". This denotes a client's order of connection within its pair.

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
